            I've been developing software for over 10 years, I've dedicated a good part of my career to web 
            applications, AI, data science and robotics. I have also been involved in many academic research 
            projects on computing theory, IoT, biomedical innovation, and autonomous cars.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have a bacholer degree in Computer Science from the University of Bras√≠lia (UnB), in Brazil. 
            I've worked in the academic field doing research projects, I've worked as a freelancer, 
            I've worked in outsourcing companies, banks, government agencies and startups.
        </p>

            I have a very random CV, I have been inside a major epicenter of diplomacy, at the United Nations 
            International Atomic Energy Agency (UN IAEA), nowadays I work with one of the fathers of AI, 
            Andrew NG, and I have helped to create a robot that performs laparoscopy-assisted surgery.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have led and participated in many software communities throughout my career, such as PyLadies, 
            IEEE Computer Society and Coding Dojos. I also made some contributions to open source projects 
            during my time at Google Summer of Code.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have a thirst for knowledge, so far I have focused only on my personal development, 
            but in the coming years I want to invest in the construction of projects that can impact society.
