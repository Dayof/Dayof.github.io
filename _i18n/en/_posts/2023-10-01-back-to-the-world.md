After 30 years old I have decided that I'm going to become an **indie hacker**. I feel like I have a lot of ideas and potential to just receive 20% of income of what an U.S. citizen would win on their daily basis and still suffer sexism and xenophobia once per month.

But first, what is an indie hacker?

**indie â€¢ hacker**<br>
*noun*
1. person building an online project that can generate revenue
2. person seeking financial independence, creative freedom, and the ability to work on their own schedule

In other words, I'm going to put my ideas into practice! In the last 4 companies I've worked for, I've seen a very common pattern, lost leadership, making decisions out of nowhere and leading employees to physical and emotional exhaustion without being held responsible for it, just focusing on the very fat salary in the end of the month.

This is more common than we would like, we see the perfect example of elon musk, who I don't need to go into much detail given the clear damage he is causing on Twitter (I will never call it X, what a terrible name). We clearly see that many leaders are only where they are because they had good money to start with, which guaranteed them attention and power.

So in the spirit of the tri force, I will unite my courage and wisdom and go in search of my power ðŸ’ª.
